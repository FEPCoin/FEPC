# Future Economy Pay [FEPC]

In twenty years, nearly all data will become digitised. FEPC is an innovative blockchain enabling Artificial Intelligence.

Coin name: Future Economy Pay

Coin ticker: FEPC

Main net launch: 08-04-2023

FEPC is based on Dynex's (https://dynexcoin.org) pioneering work in the field of neuromorphic computing but is a pure CryptoNight based POW coin. Miners can optionally perform scientific computations but also use ASICs for mining.

## Artificial Intelligence

In twenty years, nearly all data will become digitised, making it possible to use AI for decision-making and optimization. AI and automation will replace most blue-collar work and “make” products for minimal marginal cost. Robots and AI will take over the manufacturing, delivery, design and marketing of most goods. FEPC is an innovative blockchain enabling Artificial Intelligence. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology are two groundbreaking innovations that have been transforming various industries independently. However, the convergence of these two technologies holds tremendous potential to revolutionise how we harness the power of data, enhance trust, and unlock new possibilities for AI. In this article, we will explore the ways in which AI can benefit from blockchain and the promising implications it brings.

## Neuromorphic Computing

Neuromorphic computing is an approach to designing computer systems that takes inspiration from the human brain. In simple terms, it aims to create computer chips that work more like our brains do. The human brain is incredibly powerful and efficient at processing information. It consists of billions of interconnected neurons that communicate with each other using electrical signals. Neuromorphic computing tries to mimic this structure and function of the brain to perform computations.

Our blockchain has been designed to support Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence tasks. Miners can not only contribute hashing to the blockchain, but can also run Neuromorphic computations, which are at the core of any next generation system.
